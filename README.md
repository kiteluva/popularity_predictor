1. OBJECTIVE
Create an app that predicts spotify songs' popularity scores

2. METHODOLOGY
I intend to use the shinny library on R studio to create the app. Create a Css code to make the app appealing, and add a js script too.
Add a json file for icons too.

3. BUILDING
First I create a shinny script, load my best reggresion model, create an empty dataset that will be the outputs.
Now specify the inputs and the values. Afterwards create  the ui. Link the Css Js and Json files that you created with the shinny script.
Afterwards publish the app on shinny.oi.
Test the app to see if it works; smoothly.
